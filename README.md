## ⚠️ TMDB API Access Notice (Important)

This project uses the **TMDB (The Movie Database) API** to fetch movie posters and additional movie details.

### ❗ Important Note for Users in India

Due to certain restrictions, **TMDB API access may be blocked in India**.  
As a result:

- Movie posters may not load
- The application may throw errors while fetching data from TMDB
- The app may not run as expected when poster fetching is enabled

### ✅ Solution

To run the application **without errors** and to **successfully fetch movie posters**, please make sure to:

- Use a **VPN** while running the application
- Ensure the VPN allows access to TMDB services

Once the VPN is active, the application should work normally without any TMDB-related issues.

---

🔹 If you do not want to use a VPN, you can:
- Disable poster fetching logic in `app.py`, or
- Modify the app to run only with local data

Because of this error "Yowza, that’s a big file. Try again with a file smaller than 25MB."
i do not upload movies_similarity.pkl and series_similarity.pkl file.
to run app.py you want similarity files so you can downnload these files from Recommandation_system.ipynb notebook.
